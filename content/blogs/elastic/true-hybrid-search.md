# Hybrid Search Done Right: Stop Calling Metadata Filters "Hybrid"

Everyone‚Äôs talking about **hybrid search** right now.
But here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth:

üëâ Just because you glued vector search onto your database and added metadata filters doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve built *true* hybrid search.

That‚Äôs like duct-taping a spoiler on a hatchback and calling it a race car. üöóüí®

Hybrid search is more than just ‚Äúkeyword + vector + filter.‚Äù
It‚Äôs about **field-level design, reranking, scoring, and scale**.

Let‚Äôs break this down.

---

## Field-Level Truth: Not Every Field Deserves Semantic Search

The biggest mistake I see:
Teams running semantic + lexical search on *every* field in their JSON docs.

That‚Äôs how you kill relevance.

### Lexical-Only Fields
These work best with exact match:
- `title`
- `name`
- `issue_id`
- `category`
- `tags`

If I search for `issue_id: 1245`, I want **1245** ‚Äî not ‚Äúsimilar looking IDs.‚Äù

### Semantic-Only Fields
These benefit from embeddings:
- `product_description`
- `movie_storyline`
- `customer_feedback`
- `reviews`

This is where meaning > keywords.
‚ÄúBattery dies too quickly‚Äù should match with ‚Äúpoor battery life.‚Äù

### The Formula That Works
```text
Final Score = RRF(
   Lexical(title, name, category) +
   Semantic(description, feedback, reviews)
)
```

Hybrid works when **each field is treated for what it is**.

### Quick Reference Table

| Field Type            | Example Fields            | Best Search Method | Why? |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------|
| Metadata / Identifiers | `id`, `issue_id`, `category` | Lexical             | Needs exact matching, filtering |
| Structured Short Text  | `title`, `name`, `tags`    | Lexical             | Precision > meaning |
| Unstructured Text      | `description`, `reviews`   | Semantic            | Context + meaning matter |

## Metadata Filters: Keep Them Lexical

One of the biggest anti-patterns: vectorizing filters.

Filters are not semantic. They should remain **exact**.

- Price ‚Üí numeric filters
- Stock availability ‚Üí boolean
- Categories, IDs ‚Üí keyword
- Timestamps, geo ‚Üí structured fields

Search is about *precision here*. If you fuzzy up filters with embeddings, you‚Äôll tank user trust.

---

## Hybrid ‚â† Metadata Filters + Vectors

Here‚Äôs the thing. Some vector DBs shout *‚Äúwe support keyword search now!‚Äù*
But if you look closer, it‚Äôs often:
- A bolted-on library
- Or patched-in metadata filters

Yeah, technically it works.
But **that‚Äôs not hybrid**.

Search is not just filters.

---

## What Real Hybrid Search Looks Like

Let‚Äôs talk the real stuff beyond filters + vectors:

- **Autocomplete** ‚Äî search-as-you-type, phrase suggesters, boosting, user-friendly completion.
- **Facets** ‚Äî powerful aggregations: geo boundaries, date histograms, bucketing. Not just string counts.
- **Native rescoring** ‚Äî query rescorer, rank features, boosting for freshness, popularity, personalization.
- **Rich documents** ‚Äî nested JSON, arrays, geo points, IPs. Search isn‚Äôt flat.
- **Geo Search** ‚Äî aggregations, polygons, proximity scoring. Beyond just ‚Äúin radius.‚Äù
- **Access control** ‚Äî index ‚Üí document ‚Üí field level security. For lexical **and** vector fields.
- **Data enrichment pipelines** ‚Äî entity extraction, tagging, embeddings, LLM-based enrichment.
- **Scalability** ‚Äî petabytes of data, tiered storage, lifecycle management. Search doesn‚Äôt stop at 10M docs.

This is hybrid.

## Vectors: Ask the Hard Questions

Not all vector support is equal. Check:

- Is vector search **native to the engine** or bolted on?
- Query types: KNN, ANN, hybrid filtering?
- Can it run at scale with good recall + low latency?
- Quantization: int4, int8, binary, advanced methods like **BBQ (Better Binary Quantization)**?
- Filters on HNSW: is it pre-filtering or filter-aware indexing (like ACORN)?
- Can it blend semantic + lexical scoring at query time?
   - RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
   - Linear retrievers
   - Semantic reranking with LLMs

If your engine can‚Äôt do these, it‚Äôs not serious about hybrid.

---

## Implementation Note: One Query Should Do It

If you need to stitch 3‚Äì4 services together just to get:
- Facets
- Filters
- Semantic results
- Lexical results
- Reranking

‚Ä¶you‚Äôre adding **latency + complexity**.

A true hybrid engine should give you everything in **one structured query**.

---

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Not all fields deserve semantic.** Treat fields differently.
2. **Filters are lexical.** Stop semantic-izing metadata.
3. **Hybrid = lexical + semantic + rescoring + scale.** Not just bolted-on keyword support.
4. **Evaluate vectors deeply.** Native support, quantization, filtering, reranking.
5. **One query > stitched services.** Hybrid done right = clean pipeline, low latency.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Hybrid search is not a checkbox.
It‚Äôs about designing for **relevance + scale + control**.

If your ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù is just vectors + filters, you‚Äôve built a demo ‚Äî not a real search engine.

True hybrid is **Lexical + Semantic + Scoring + Access + Scale + Control**.
That‚Äôs when search feels natural, accurate, and production-ready.
