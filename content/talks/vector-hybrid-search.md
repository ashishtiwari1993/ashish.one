# Introduction

Search is not just traditional TF/IDF any more but the current trend of machine learning and models has opened another dimension for search.

This talk gives an overview of:

* **Classic** search and its limitations.
* What is a model and how can you use it.
* How to use vector search or hybrid search in Elasticsearch.
* Where OpenAI's ChatGPT or similar LLMs come into play to with Elastic.
