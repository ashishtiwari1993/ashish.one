# Introduction

Bring logs, metrics, and traces from your Kubernetes cluster and the workloads running on it into a single, unified solution. Elastic observability gives better visibility on your kubernetes ecosystem where you can monitor your pods, services, workload etc. Use a centrally managed Elastic Agent to gain visibility into your Kubernetes deployments on EKS, AKS, GKE or self-managed clusters.
