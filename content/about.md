I’m a Principal Solutions Architect – Search Specialist, passionate about building and scaling search and GenAI-driven solutions. My journey started as a Software Engineer, and over the years I’ve worked across diverse stacks, databases, and programming languages—solving real-world problems and learning from some of the best minds in the industry.

Having worn multiple hats in startups, I’ve gained hands-on experience in system design, architecture, scaling, coding, maintenance, customer support, marketing, and community engagement. Lately, my focus has been on Generative AI, vector search, embeddings, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—helping bridge the gap between unstructured data and intelligent search experiences.

I’m an open-source enthusiast who loves contributing back and sharing knowledge through blogs, talks, and community initiatives. Outside of work, I spend time experimenting with new technologies, writing, and engaging with the community.

Based in Mumbai, India, this space is where I share my thoughts, learnings, and findings around the evolving world of Search and GenAI.

Thanks.
