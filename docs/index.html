  Introduction In PART-1 and PART-2, We have seen how prometheus works and how to setup Prometheus and exporters. We have readymade exporters available on the internet.
But sometime there is situation where you need to store your own custom metrics on prometheus. In such case you have to write your own exporters which will exporters the data into Prometheus.
There is two way to exporting the data on prometheus: 1.

  Introduction In PART - 1, We have successfully setup Prometheus and exporters. In this part, we are going to setup alertmanager and will send our first alert.
Alertmanager is software that is maintained by the prometheus and it is written in Go. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

  As a developer, many times you would have worried, whether your services are up and running or not. Not only that, sometimes as an infrastructure guy you might be also worried about your server’s health too. What is the current RAM or disk utilization? or whether they are going to be fully occupied which in turn can completely bring the system down. These are just the basics and in fact there are tons of more such things which need to be monitored and fixed in everyday&rsquo;s life.

  I was working on elasticsearch and the requirement was to implement like query “%text%” ( like mysql %like% ). We could use wildcard, regex or query string but those are slow. Hence i took decision to use ngram token filter for like query. It was quickly implemented on local and works exactly i want.
The problem To know the actual behavior, I implemented the same on staging server. I found some problem while we start indexing on staging.
