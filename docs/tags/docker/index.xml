      <description>Hi guys, In this series, we are going to setup LEMP Stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP). Mainly it is used by web developers. I am assuming you have a basic idea about Docker &amp;amp; How it works.
In this blog, We are going to setup PHP and Nginx.
Why Docker? I will not go too much deep, You can find more resources over the internet about the docker.
Docker makes the installation process very smooth and it gives your isolated environment as the container.</description>
