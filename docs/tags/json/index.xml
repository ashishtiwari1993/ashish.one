      <description>Goal of this blog In this blog, I am going to show you how easily we can write logs to the files in Golang. As well as we are going to store all logs on elasticsearch with EKB (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats).
Why ELKB stack ? Logs are very important for debugging, reporting, insights etc. In today&amp;rsquo;s tech world, We uses multiple cloud servers, private servers etc. Which consist of lots of different applications, scripts, programs, daemons, services and they generate their logs too.</description>
