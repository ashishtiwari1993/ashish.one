    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Hi guys, In this series, we are going to setup LEMP Stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP). Mainly it is used by web developers. I am assuming you have a basic idea about Docker &amp; How it works.
In this blog, We are going to setup PHP and Nginx.
Why Docker? I will not go too much deep, You can find more resources over the internet about the docker.
Docker makes the installation process very smooth and it gives your isolated environment as the container.

      I was working on elasticsearch and the requirement was to implement like query “%text%” ( like mysql %like% ). We could use wildcard, regex or query string but those are slow. Hence i took decision to use ngram token filter for like query. It was quickly implemented on local and works exactly i want.
The problem To know the actual behavior, I implemented the same on staging server. I found some problem while we start indexing on staging.

      Introduction This article is not containing the detailed procedure for installation but listed some challenges which you can face while installing the arch Linux. Arch Linux is one of the Linux distributions, Which gives you full control over your application and OS. You have complete freedom to install or what to keep. Unlike the other distribution like Ubuntu, Centos, etc. It doesn&rsquo;t come with pre-loaded applications or software.
Though Arch wiki has a detailed explanation of the installation process I faced some challenges whose solution was not easily available.

      As you know Prometheus already having UI (localhost:9090). But it is not enough to give you better visualization on one screen. For better visualization and a graphical representation, we are going to use Grafana.
What is Grafana? As grafana.com says
 ”Grafana is the open-source analytics and monitoring solution for every database.”
 This means Grafana is an independent tool for analytics and monitor which gives your various types of Graphs.

But sometime there is situation where you need to store your own custom metrics on prometheus. In such case you have to write your own exporters which will exporters the data into Prometheus.
There is two way to exporting the data on prometheus: 1. Exporting to a Pushgateway Here we metrics are getting the push to prometheus server.

Alertmanager is software that is maintained by the prometheus and it is written in Go. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

      As a developer, many times you would have worried, whether your services are up and running or not. Not only that, sometimes as an infrastructure guy you might be also worried about your server’s health too. What is the current RAM or disk utilization? or whether they are going to be fully occupied which in turn can completely bring the system down. These are just the basics and in fact there are tons of more such things which need to be monitored and fixed in everyday&rsquo;s life.

The Fact The fact is there is no hard and fast rule or there is no standard course by following which you will get the tag of a security expert.
 There is no defined way to become a security researcher.
