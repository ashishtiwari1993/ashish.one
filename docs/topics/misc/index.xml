      <description>I have always been in confusion about how to get started with security or pentest or somehow with a bug bounty. There are tons of resources available on the internet.
The Fact The fact is there is no hard and fast rule or there is no standard course by following which you will get the tag of a security expert.
 There is no defined way to become a security researcher.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, In this series, we are going to setup LEMP Stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP). Mainly it is used by web developers. I am assuming you have a basic idea about Docker &amp;amp; How it works.
In this blog, We are going to setup PHP and Nginx.
Why Docker? I will not go too much deep, You can find more resources over the internet about the docker.
Docker makes the installation process very smooth and it gives your isolated environment as the container.</description>
