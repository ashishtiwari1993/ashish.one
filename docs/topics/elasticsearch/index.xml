      <description>Goal of this blog In this blog, I am going to show you how easily we can write logs to the files in Golang. As well as we are going to store all logs on elasticsearch with EKB (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats).
Why ELKB stack ? Logs are very important for debugging, reporting, insights etc. In today&amp;rsquo;s tech world, We uses multiple cloud servers, private servers etc. Which consist of lots of different applications, scripts, programs, daemons, services and they generate their logs too.</description>

      <description>I was working on elasticsearch and the requirement was to implement like query “%text%” ( like mysql %like% ). We could use wildcard, regex or query string but those are slow. Hence i took decision to use ngram token filter for like query. It was quickly implemented on local and works exactly i want.
The problem To know the actual behavior, I implemented the same on staging server. I found some problem while we start indexing on staging.</description>
