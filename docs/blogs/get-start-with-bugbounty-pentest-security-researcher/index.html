<h2 id="the-fact">The Fact</h2>
<p>The fact is there is no hard and fast rule or there is no standard course by following which you will get the tag of a security expert.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no defined way to become a security researcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here at the end, I am also going to give you some resources about the get started but to be honest it will not help until you start with a practice or use it in your day-to-day life for learning purposes.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-missing">So what missing?</h2>
<p>Resources will get the directions for learning. Letâ€™s say you got one blog where the blogger explains everything steps by step and You decided to complete it in 7 days. Your approach SHOULD NOT be that once you finish with the whole tutorial you should start with researching it wonâ€™t help or probably you must have forgotten the things which you learned on day 1.</p>
<h2 id="the-approach">The Approach</h2>
<p>Start performing practical from the first day. Whatever your learning start implementing those. Try to find the smallest loopholes. And trust me you wonâ€™t get it on Day 1. But with the practice, you will become to know how to find or where to find.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-do-practice">Where to do practice?</h2>
<p>You can use any Bugbounty side where lots of products, apps, websites get listed to find bugs, vulnerabilities, etc. You can also use CTF (Capture the flag). I will not go in deep with these terminologies because you can find better explanations on google. You will also get a better guide on how to start with these platforms.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t Forget your practice will give you a real security expert badge. Keep practicing.</p>
