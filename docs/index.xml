      <description>I have always been in confusion about how to get started with security or pentest or somehow with a bug bounty. There are tons of resources available on the internet.
The Fact The fact is there is no hard and fast rule or there is no standard course by following which you will get the tag of a security expert.
 There is no defined way to become a security researcher.</description>

      <title>SPF Lookup in Go</title>
      <link>https://ashish.one/gist/spf-lookup-in-go/</link>

      <guid>https://ashish.one/gist/spf-lookup-in-go/</guid>
      <description>In this gist, We will check how we can extract SPF records in Go.
Prerequisite Go version $ go version go version go1.13 linux/amd64 Dependency DNS Library(https://github.com/miekg/dns)
Install dependency $ go get github.com/miekg/dns spfLookup.go  Here you can change nameserver according to your requirement. I have specified here google&amp;rsquo;s name server (8.8.8.8). You can also use cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s nameserver (1.1.1.1)
Conclusion You can make any DNS query with miekg/dns library. In the above script, we have looked up TXT Records and then we have searched for a string containing v=spf1.</description>

      <guid>https://ashish.one/blogs/shipping-golang-logs-with-elkb-stack/</guid>
      <description>Goal of this blog In this blog, I am going to show you how easily we can write logs to the files in Golang. As well as we are going to store all logs on elasticsearch with EKB (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats).
Why ELKB stack ? Logs are very important for debugging, reporting, insights etc. In today&amp;rsquo;s tech world, We uses multiple cloud servers, private servers etc. Which consist of lots of different applications, scripts, programs, daemons, services and they generate their logs too.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, In this series, we are going to setup LEMP Stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP). Mainly it is used by web developers. I am assuming you have a basic idea about Docker &amp;amp; How it works.
In this blog, We are going to setup PHP and Nginx.
Why Docker? I will not go too much deep, You can find more resources over the internet about the docker.
Docker makes the installation process very smooth and it gives your isolated environment as the container.</description>

      <description>As you know Prometheus already having UI (localhost:9090). But it is not enough to give you better visualization on one screen. For better visualization and a graphical representation, we are going to use Grafana.
What is Grafana? As grafana.com says
 ‚ÄùGrafana is the open-source analytics and monitoring solution for every database.‚Äù
 This means Grafana is an independent tool for analytics and monitor which gives your various types of Graphs.</description>

      <description>Introduction What this talk is all about? We recently moved from MySQL to Elasticsearch where we got a direct 10x - 15x boost in our performance.
We came up with unique use cases of heavy updates in Elasticsearch. That been challenging but yes currently Our Elaticsearch handling 200 million requests per day very efficiently. Our WRITE consist of the partial update, update with script conditions and of course simple indexing.</description>

      <description>Introduction In PART-1 and PART-2, We have seen how prometheus works and how to setup Prometheus and exporters. We have readymade exporters available on the internet.
But sometime there is situation where you need to store your own custom metrics on prometheus. In such case you have to write your own exporters which will exporters the data into Prometheus.
There is two way to exporting the data on prometheus: 1. Exporting to a Pushgateway Here we metrics are getting the push to prometheus server.</description>

      <description>Introduction In PART - 1, We have successfully setup Prometheus and exporters. In this part, we are going to setup alertmanager and will send our first alert.
Alertmanager is software that is maintained by the prometheus and it is written in Go. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.</description>

      <description>As a developer, many times you would have worried, whether your services are up and running or not. Not only that, sometimes as an infrastructure guy you might be also worried about your server‚Äôs health too. What is the current RAM or disk utilization? or whether they are going to be fully occupied which in turn can completely bring the system down. These are just the basics and in fact there are tons of more such things which need to be monitored and fixed in everyday&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

      <guid>https://ashish.one/blogs/min-gram-and-max-gram-elasticsearch/</guid>
      <description>I was working on elasticsearch and the requirement was to implement like query ‚Äú%text%‚Äù ( like mysql %like% ). We could use wildcard, regex or query string but those are slow. Hence i took decision to use ngram token filter for like query. It was quickly implemented on local and works exactly i want.
The problem To know the actual behavior, I implemented the same on staging server. I found some problem while we start indexing on staging.</description>
